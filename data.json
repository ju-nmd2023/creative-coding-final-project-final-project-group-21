        "description": "An interactive generative artwork inspired by neural growth. Each click releases a burst of organic lines that grow, branch, and connect into a living network â€” softly guided by the viewer's movements. A piano loop creates a calming atmosphere, in which the viewer can control the sound easily through the keyboard."
